# Workday-Scheduler

## The Task

By modifying starter code, create a simple calendar application that allows users to save events for each hour of the day.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When the user opens the calendar the date is displayed at the top of the calender.
2. When you scroll down the user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours.
3. When the user views the time blocks, each time block is color-coded to indicated whether it is past, present, future.
4. When the user clicks into a time block they can enter an event.
5. When the user clicks the save button for that time block, then the event is saved in local storage.
6. When the user refreshes the page, then the saved event remains.
